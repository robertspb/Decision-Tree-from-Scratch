# Decision Tree from Scratch
This is a study project that implements a simple decision tree algorithm.

It accepts as input a string indicating the paths to two files (a training dataset and a test dataset) separated by a space. The output shows normalized true positives and true negatives.

When initializing a class, you can specify:
* minimum number of elements to stop branching
* list of numeric columns
